# POLH - Programming language by programmer for programmers

The guiding principles of this language are as follow:

- everything executes (hopefully also works)
- make it hard to make mistakes
- code should be readable

Some background: After years of dealing with various languages that severly punish you for the slightest mistake 
I've decided to make a language that treats you as a human rather than a syntactically correct machine.
It might not be the most effective production ready language in existance but we have plenty of those already.
Now for some humanity.
